%% IMPORTANT: The official thesis specifications are available at:

%%
%%            Please verify your thesis' formatting and copyright
%%            assignment before submission.  If you notice any
%%            discrepancies between these templates and the 
%%            MIT Libraries' specs, please let us know
%%            by e-mailing thesis@mit.edu

%% The documentclass options along with the pagestyle can be used to generate
%% a technical report, a draft copy, or a regular thesis.  You may need to
%% re-specify the pagestyle after you \include  cover.tex.  For more
%% information, see the first few lines of mitthesis.cls. 

%\documentclass[12pt,vi,twoside]{mitthesis}
%%
%%  If you want your thesis copyright to you instead of MIT, use the
%%  ``vi'' option, as above.
%%
%\documentclass[12pt,twoside,leftblank]{mitthesis}
%%
%% If you want blank pages before new chapters to be labelled ``This
%% Page Intentionally Left Blank'', use the ``leftblank'' option, as
%% above.
