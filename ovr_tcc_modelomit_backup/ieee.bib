abstract={In order to navigate efficiently in its working space a mobile robot has to use some kind of map. To be completely autonomous the robot has to generate such a representation automatically by exploring all reachable area of the a priori unknown environment. Thus an exploration strategy for generating a complete and accurate map within minimal time is a key feature. This paper presents an integrated mapping and exploration approach that uses a 3D reconstruction technique for extracting a ground plan of the environment and for detecting interesting places (NBVs) that trigger the exploration process.},

year={2011}, 
pages={337-343}, 
abstract={We enhance the Multi layer Perceptron to map a feature vector not only from the original d-dimensional feature space, but from an intermediate implicit Hilbert feature space in which kernels calculate inner products. The kernel substitutes the usual inner product between weight vectors and the input vector (or the feature vector of the hidden layer). The objective is to boost the generalization capability of this universal function approximator even more. Classification experiments with standard Machine Learning data sets are shown. We are able to improve the classification accuracy performance criterion for certain kernel types and their intrinsic parameters for the majority of the data sets.},

pages={923-928}, 
abstract={This paper presents a laser-based obstacle detection facility for off-road robotics in vegetated terrain. In the context of this work the mobile off-road platform RAVON was equipped with a 3D laser scanner and accompanying evaluation routines working on individual vertical scans. Identified terrain characteristics are used to build up a local representation of the environment. Introducing the abstraction concept of virtual sensors the transparent integration of additional terrain information on the basis of standardized behavior modules can be achieved.},

volume={3}, 
pages={2185-2190 vol.3}, 
abstract={Locomotion of walking machines on a well defined path in unstructured terrain requires a model of the environment. But, in particular, middle sized robots like LAURON III don't provide the possibility to carry large or heavy sensors. This paper focuses on generating a 3D map of unstructured environment on the basis of sparse sensory information. In respect of walking robots this covers at first the selection of the next footsteps. For this purpose the advanced inference grid is introduced as a variant of the vector field histogram for the representation of the environment.},
